 
REVOCABLE IDENTITY-BASED BROADCAST PROXY RE-
ENCRYPTION FOR DATA SHARING IN CLOUDS 
 
ABSTRACT: 
      Cloud computing has become prevalent due to its nature of massive storage and vast 
computing capabilities. Ensuring a secure data sharing is critical to cloud applications. Recently, 
a number of identity-based broadcast proxy re-encryption schemes have been proposed to 
resolve the problem. However, the IB-BPRE requires a cloud user who wants to share data with 
a bunch of other users to participate the group shared key renewal process because Alice’s 
private key is a prerequisite for shared key generation. This, however, does not leverage the 
benefit of cloud computing and causes the inconvenience for cloud users. Therefore, a novel 
security notion named revocable identity-based broadcast proxy re-encryption is presented to 
address the issue of key revocation in this work. In a RIB-BPRE scheme, a proxy can revoke a 
set of delegates, designated by the delegator, from the re-encryption key. The performance 
evaluation reveals that the proposed scheme is efficient and practical. 
 
INTRODUCTION: 
Cloud computing has become a solution for data maintenance due to its flexibility and 
effectiveness. However, cloud computing has been suffering from security and privacy 
challenges. Encryption can be a straightforward approach to ensure data confidentiality and 
Identity-based encryption is one of the promising representative secure mechanisms because it 
has a concise public key infrastructure. When storing the identity-based encrypted data to the 
cloud, the data owner would like to share the data with others in particular scenarios. For 
example, a set of volunteers upload their genome data to the cloud in a genome record cloud 
system for the scientists to collaboratively conduct medical research. If IBE is adopted into such 
a medical system, the genome data should be encrypted before uploading to the cloud as Enc(m,
