littler subsets while simultaneously a related choice tree is steadily evolved. SUPPORT VECTOR
MACHINES (SVM): A classifier that sorts the informational collection by setting an ideal hyper
plane between information. I picked this classifier as it is fantastically flexible in the quantity of
various kernelling capacities that can be applied and this model can yield a high consistency
rate. RANDOM FOREST: Arbitrary timberlands or irregular choice woodlands are an outfit
learning strategy for grouping, relapse and different assignments, that work by building a large
number of choice trees at preparing time and yielding the class that is the method of the
classes (order) or mean expectation (relapse) of the individual trees. Arbitrary choice
timberlands right for choice trees' propensity for over fitting to their preparation set.K -
NEAREST NEIGHBOR (KNN):K -Nearest Neighbor is a managed AI calculation which stores all
examples relate to preparing information focuses in n-dimensional space. At the point when
obscure discrete information is gotten, it investigates the nearest k number of occurrences
spared (closest neighbors) and returns the most widely recognized class as the forecast and
for genuine esteemed information it restores the mean of k closest neighbors.NAIVE BAYES
ALGORITHM: The Naive Bayes calculation is a natural technique that utilizes the probabilities of
each ascribes having a place with each class to make a forecast. It is the administered learning
approach you would think of on the off chance that you needed to display a prescient
demonstrating issue probabilistically.VII I RESULT AND DISCUSSIONThe aim of the entire
project was to test which algorithm predicts the best crop and cost with higher accuracy. This
section includes all the results obtained from the study and introduces the best performer

in this study. First, we want to evaluate our proposed system using additional appropriate data
sets which preferably have a large number of data records. Can automate the detecting the
yield crops from eligibility process in real time. To automate this process by show the
prediction result in web application or desktop application and to optimize the work to
implement in Artificial Intelligence environment. X. CONCLUSIONThe proposed system was to
compare the algorithms with different performance metrics using machine learning. All data
were pre-processed and used for the prediction. Random Forest and Decision Tree are the
likely model to work best in the dataset used in this study. Different sources such as 'Sensors',
used to capture the essential features based on which Crop yield can be predicted. With further
research machine learning can also be used to predict the Crop yield better than the human
experts can do. The analytical process started from data cleaning and processing, missing
value, exploratory analysis and finally model building and evaluation. Finally, we predict the
crop using machine learning algorithm with different results. The best accuracy on public test
set is higher accuracy score by Machine learning method from calculating cross validation
checking, Precision, recall and F1score in future. This brings some of the following insights
about crop prediction. As maximum types of crops will be covered under this system, farmer
may get to know about the crop which may never have been cultivated and lists out all
possible crops, it helps the farmer in decision making of which crop to cultivate. Also, this
system takes into consideration the past production of data which will help the farmer get
insight into the demand and the cost of various crops in market. X I.REFERENCES[1]. Becker-
